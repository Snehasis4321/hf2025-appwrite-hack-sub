## Project Title
AI Language Learning App

## Project Description    
AI Language Learning Teacher is a real-time voice conversation platform that enables students to practice language skills through natural conversations with an AI teacher. The platform adapts to different difficulty levels (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) and topics, providing live transcription, gentle corrections, and contextual explanations. Students can practice anytime through voice or text chat, making language learning accessible and engaging without needing to schedule human tutors.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The project was inspired by the need to revolutionize language learning by enabling natural, real-time voice conversations with an AI
teacher, unlike traditional apps that rely on scripted lessons. This approach makes practice more engaging, accessible, and
personalized, allowing students to learn anytime without scheduling human tutors.
